This directory contains the core domain entities and shared data models for the Mentor project.
These files define the structure of data used throughout the system.

Context for AI:
- `common.proto`: Basic reusable types.
- Future entities (e.g., `avatar.proto`, `chat.proto`) will reside here.
- All files mimic the structure of `biconom/types` but for the Mentor domain.
